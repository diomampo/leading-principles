# leading-principles
A rundown of principles I apply to leadership at work and in life.

# Core Values
* I believe that expectations should be clear and made upfront.
* I believe that failure is merely a step in the process towards success.
* I believe our mark is made by leaving things better than how we initially found them.

# Communication
* I will provide positive and negative feedback in a constructive manner, early and often.
* I will encourage you to gather feedback from others, beyond just me.
* I will create opportunities for you to provide feedback.

# Comprehension
* I will think out loud to help clarify intent.
* I will seek to provide context for the work you take on.
* I will ask you questions to ensure we have a shared understanding.

# Growth
* I will seek and create opportunities that challenge you. See [Goldilocks Principle of Challenge](https://www.google.com/search?q=goldilocks+principles+of+challenge).
* I will partner with you to organize and provide training that is relevant to your future goals.
* I will NOT have all the answers to your questions, but I will work with you to find them.

# Meetings
* I will regularly meet with you 1 on 1.
* I will periodically meet with you to discuss your big goals.
* I will protect your time as much as possible from distractions, including myself.

# Other
* I will make mistakes, so please keep me honest and hold me accountable.
