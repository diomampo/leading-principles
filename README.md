# leading-principles
A rundown of principles I apply to leadership. Expect these to evolve over time and be sure to hold me accountable should I ever slip.

# Core Values
* I believe that expectations should be clear and made upfront.
* I believe that failure is merely a step in the process towards success.
* I believe our mark is made by leaving things better than how we initially found them.

# Communication
* I will provide positive and negative feedback in a constructive manner, early and often.
* I will encourage you to gather feedback from others, beyond just me.
* I will create opportunities for you to provide feedback.
