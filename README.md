# leading-principles
A rundown of my own personal principles. Expect these to evolve over time and be sure to hold me accountable should I ever slip.

# Core Values
* I believe that expectations should be clear and made upfront.
* I believe that failure is merely a step in the process towards success.
* I believe our mark is made by leaving things better than how we initially found them.
